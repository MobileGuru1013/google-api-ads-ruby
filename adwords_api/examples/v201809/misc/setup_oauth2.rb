# This example illustrates how to set up OAuth2 authentication credentials.

require 'adwords_api'

def setup_oauth2()
  # AdwordsApi::Api will read a config file from ENV['HOME']/adwords_api.yml
  # when called without parameters.
  adwords = AdwordsApi::Api.new

  # To enable logging of SOAP requests, set the log_level value to 'DEBUG' in
  # the configuration file or provide your own logger:
  # adwords.logger = Logger.new('adwords_xml.log')

  # You can call authorize explicitly to obtain the access token. Otherwise, it
  # will be invoked automatically on the first API call.
  # There are two ways to provide verification code, first one is via the block:
  token = adwords.authorize() do |auth_url|
    puts "Hit Auth error, please navigate to URL:\n\t%s" % auth_url
    print 'log in and type the verification code: '
    verification_code = gets.chomp
    verification_code
  end
  if token
    print "\nWould you like to update your adwords_api.yml to save " +
        "OAuth2 credentials? (y/N): "
    response = gets.chomp
    if ('y'.casecmp(response) == 0) or ('yes'.casecmp(response) == 0)
      adwords.save_oauth2_token(token)
      puts 'OAuth2 token is now saved to ~/adwords_api.yml and will be ' +
          'automatically used by the library.'
    end
  end

  # Alternatively, you can provide one within the parameters:
  # token = adwords.authorize({:oauth2_verification_code => verification_code})

  # Note, 'token' is a Hash. Its value is not used in this example. If you need
  # to be able to access the API in offline mode, with no user present, you
  # should persist it to be used in subsequent invocations like this:
  # adwords.authorize({:oauth2_token => token})

  # No exception thrown - we are good to make a request.
