# This example illustrates how to use OAuth2 authentication method with
# Service Account (JWT). For this example to work, your Service Account must be
# a G Suite account.
#
# See https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/service-accounts
# for more information.

require 'adwords_api'

def use_oauth2_jwt()
  # AdwordsApi::Api will read a config file from ENV['HOME']/adwords_api.yml
  # when called without parameters.
  adwords = AdwordsApi::Api.new

  # To enable logging of SOAP requests, set the log_level value to 'DEBUG' in
  # the configuration file or provide your own logger:
  # adwords.logger = Logger.new('adwords_xml.log')

  # Option 1: provide key filename as authentication -> oauth2_keyfile in the
  #           configuration file. No additional code is necessary.
  # To provide a file name at runtime, use authorize:
  # adwords.authorize({:oauth2_keyfile => key_filename})

  # Option 2: retrieve key manually and create OpenSSL::PKCS12 object.
  # key_filename = 'INSERT_FILENAME_HERE'
  # key_secret = 'INSERT_SECRET_HERE'
  # key_file_data = File.read(key_filename)
  # key = OpenSSL::PKCS12.new(key_file_data, key_secret).key
  # adwords.authorize({:oauth2_key => key})

  # Now you can make API calls.
  campaign_srv = adwords.service(:CampaignService, API_VERSION)

  # Get all the campaigns for this account; empty selector.

    :fields => ['Id', 'Name', 'Status'],
